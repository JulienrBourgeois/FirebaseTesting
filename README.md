# FirebaseTesting
This repository is an Xcode project called FirebaseAccountSystem that demonstrates a basic account system and linked database through Google Firebase's core features. 

This app provides all of the basic account system functionality such as signing up, logging in, and signing out. Through firebase API,
the app can generate unique users with sign in credentials and link profile content to said credentials. This is the basis of databases
for many apps.
